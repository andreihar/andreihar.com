# Project Overview

ChhármCooks is a React-based web application designed to facilitate the sharing and discovery of Hokkien cuisine recipes. It has a powerful backend and an intuitive frontend to create a dynamic space for culinary enthusiasts to explore and contribute to the rich tradition of Hokkien cooking.

# Objective and Vision

The objective was to create a comprehensive recipe-sharing platform that not only allows users to share and explore recipes but also to engage with Hokkien cuisine in a meaningful way. The vision was to provide a seamless user experience that combines robust functionality with an engaging interface, enabling users to celebrate and preserve Hokkien culinary traditions through interactive features.

# Tools and Technologies

ChhármCooks utilises several technologies to achieve its goals:

- **React**: For building the frontend application.
- **Auth0**: For user authentication and management.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern UI design.
- **Tiptap**: For integrating a rich-text editor to enhance blog-style recipe descriptions.
- **Express**: For developing the backend API.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management and storing recipe data.

# Key Features

## Authentication

Users can sign up and sign in using Auth0, with a multi-step signup process for enhanced profile customisation. Authentication ensures secure access to features like recipe creation and modification.

## Filtering and Searching

The platform offers robust filtering and search capabilities, allowing users to find recipes by name or filter by national and regional cuisines within Hokkien cooking.

## Recipe Creation

The recipe creation feature allows users to craft new recipes using an intuitive form with real-time image previews and flexible fields for ingredients and directions. A hierarchical cuisine selection aids in accurately categorising each recipe. Users can also enrich their recipes with blog-style content through an integrated text editor. This feature supports the addition of detailed descriptions, cooking tips, and cultural insights, enhancing the recipe with valuable information and context. This combined approach ensures that users can create comprehensive, well-categorised recipes and provide engaging, informative content to accompany them.

## Recipe Showcase

Recipes are prominently displayed on the Home Page, showcasing detailed information such as popularity, creation, and modification dates. Each recipe is presented on a Recipe Card that includes essential details and an interactive ingredients list for efficient cooking. Users can rate recipes from 1 to 5 stars and leave comments, with the average rating shown on the Recipe Card. This integration provides a comprehensive view and interaction with recipes, enhancing user engagement and feedback.

## User Profile

The User Profile feature allows users to follow others, view detailed profiles, and explore their recipes and connections. Within the profile, users can manage their information through the Settings option, which includes updating their profile picture, social media links, and personal details.

## Notifications

Users receive notifications about new recipes and comments from their connections, keeping them engaged with recent activities.

## Localisation

The app supports English, Chinese, and Malay languages, allowing users to switch between them via a language selector.

# Challenges Faced and Solutions

Developing ChhármCooks presented several challenges, especially as it was the first web application where I developed both the frontend and backend. Integrating technologies such as React for the frontend and Express for the backend required careful synchronisation to ensure a seamless user experience. The initial challenge was managing user authentication and data integrity, especially given that I was using Auth0 for the first time.

Another significant hurdle was the lack of a clear vision for the final project. This led to feature creep, where the project expanded beyond its original scope, resulting in additional complexity and development time. As I added features like localisation, a built-in text editor, and a mini-social media system, it became evident that planning and setting clear goals are crucial.

To address these challenges, I focused on iterative development and thorough testing. Implementing features one at a time and testing them thoroughly helped to ensure that each component worked harmoniously with the others. This approach allowed me to manage the complexity and ensure a functional and cohesive application.

# Takeaways and Insights

ChhármCooks was a pivotal project in my web development journey, marking my first experience with full-stack development and React. It provided practical experience with Express and Node.js. This project also introduced me to new tools and concepts, such as localisation, Auth0 for authentication, and a Tiptap text editor for rich content creation.

One of the key takeaways from this project was the importance of planning and having a clear vision for a project. The feature creep that occurred highlighted the need for setting defined goals and understanding the project’s scope from the beginning. This experience underscored the value of careful planning in avoiding unnecessary complexity and ensuring that development efforts align with the initial objectives.
