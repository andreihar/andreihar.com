# Challenges Faced and Solutions

Knights and Knaves was my first project focused heavily on presenting visuals, text, and PDFs in an engaging way. One of the main challenges was designing a website that was both visually appealing and functional. I needed to ensure that animations, modals, and various visual elements were implemented effectively without overwhelming the user or causing performance issues. Learning to balance aesthetics with functionality required careful planning and experimentation.

To address these challenges, I invested time in mastering CSS animations and modal implementations. I used commonly overlooked CSS rules to create engaging shapes and improve the visual appeal of buttons and basic items. By focusing on using only essential libraries and optimising performance, I managed to create a smooth and visually pleasing user experience.

# Takeaways and Insights

Working on Knights and Knaves taught me valuable lessons in web design and user experience. I learned how to use animations and modals effectively to enhance the visual presentation of a website, while ensuring that it remained functional and responsive. This project was a significant step in understanding how to choose appropriate fonts and design elements to create a cohesive and attractive layout.

I also gained insights into how to present content in an engaging manner without overloading the website with unnecessary libraries, which helped maintain smooth performance. Overall, this project improved my skills in creating aesthetically pleasing websites and provided me with a solid foundation for designing visually compelling user interfaces in future projects.
