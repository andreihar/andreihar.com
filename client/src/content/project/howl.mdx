# Project Overview

HOWL Gaming is a dynamic website designed to provide in-depth information about an esports organisation. Built with React and the i18n localisation library, this project showcases detailed pages for teams, players, and matches. It features a user-friendly interface with localisation support to cater to a global audience.

# Objective and Vision

The HOWL Gaming project was created to offer a comprehensive platform for fans and stakeholders of the esports organisation. The goal was to centralise information about the team’s players, coaches, matches, and achievements, while ensuring a seamless experience for users across different languages. By leveraging modern web technologies, the project aims to deliver an engaging and interactive experience, making it easy for users to explore and stay updated with the latest developments in the esports world.

# Tools and Technologies

The original website was built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, later I added several technologies to simplify the deployment:

- **React**: The JavaScript library used for simplified routing and UI building.
- **i18n**: A localisation library to support multiple languages and enhance accessibility.

# Challenges Faced and Solutions

HOWL Gaming was my first substantial web development project after learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in high school. One of the main challenges was structuring a complex site, as I was only accustomed to building smaller, simpler websites. Managing a large volume of content and ensuring consistency across multiple pages with vanilla HTML and CSS proved difficult. The static nature of these technologies made dynamic content handling and page routing cumbersome.

Keeping track of routing between pages was particularly challenging, as HTML lacked built-in solutions for managing dynamic content and navigation effectively. These obstacles highlighted the complexity of real-world web development and the limitations of working with only basic tools. This project served as a crucial learning experience, illustrating the need for more advanced techniques and tools to manage and scale web projects effectively.

# Takeaways and Insights

Working on HOWL Gaming provided valuable insights into the realities of web development beyond my high school training. I learned the importance of structured project planning and effective content management, which was crucial for handling the complexities of a larger site. The project demonstrated the limitations of working with static technologies and underscored the need for more sophisticated tools and frameworks.

This experience made me realise how much I had learned but also how much more there was to explore in web development. It motivated me to pursue further education and deepen my understanding of modern web technologies, setting the stage for my continued growth in the field.
